# RTF - Role, Task, Format

## Overview

The **RTF Framework** (Role, Task, Format) is a structured approach to crafting prompts that ensures clear and contextually relevant responses from AI models. By explicitly defining the **Role**, **Task**, and **Format**, you enhance the precision and usefulness of the generated output.

### Framework Structure

```md
Act like a [insert role]. Give me a [insert task] in [insert format] format.
```

## Steps for Using the RTF Framework
1. Define the **Role**
    - Specify who or what the AI should act like.
    - This influences the response style, depth, and expertise.
    - Examples: “Software Developer”, “Data Scientist”, “Technical Writer”.
2. Specify the **Task**
    - Clearly state what you want the AI to do.
    - This could be summarization, analysis, explanation, coding, etc.
    - Examples: “Provide a code review”, “Summarize this article”, “Explain this concept”.
3. Choose the Output **Format**
    - Define the structure of the response.
    - Examples: “Markdown format”, “JSON format”, “Bullet points”, “Table”.

### Examples
```md
Act like a Software Developer. Give me a Code Review Summary in Markdown format.
```

```md
Act like a Data Scientist. Explain the concept of overfitting in Markdown format.
```

```md
Act like a Business Analyst. Provide a SWOT analysis of Tesla in Markdown format.
```

```md
Act like a Python Developer. Generate a function that parses JSON in Python code.
```
