# RISEN - Role, Instructions, Steps, End Goal, Narrowing

## Overview

The **RISEN Framework** is a structured approach for designing prompts that guide AI models to generate precise and actionable responses. By specifying **Role, Instructions, Steps, End Goal, and Narrowing**, you ensure that the output is well-structured, relevant, and goal-oriented.

### Framework Structure
```md
Role: [insert role]
Main Task: [Insert task.]
Steps to complete task: [Insert numbered list of steps to follow.]
Goal: [Insert goal of the output]
Constraints: [Enter constraints].
```

## Steps for Using the RISEN Framework
1. Define the **Role**
    - Assign a specific role to the AI.
    - This ensures the response aligns with the expertise and responsibilities of that role.
    - Examples: “Project Manager”, “UX Designer”, “Machine Learning Engineer”.
2. Provide Clear Instructions
    - Specify the **primary task** that needs to be completed.
    - This sets the scope and ensures relevance.
    - Examples: “Develop a marketing strategy”, “Generate a risk assessment report”, “Design a user onboarding flow”.
3. Outline **Steps to Complete the Task**
    - Break the task into a structured list of steps.
    - This guides the AI in producing a logical, process-driven response.
    - Steps should be clear, sequential, and actionable.
4. Define the **End Goal**
    - Clarify what the final output should achieve.
    - Helps maintain focus on delivering a meaningful and complete response.
    - Examples: “A structured project plan”, “A detailed troubleshooting guide”, “A persuasive executive summary”.
5. **Narrow** the Scope with Constraints
    - Add any limitations or restrictions to refine the response.
    - This ensures feasibility and aligns with real-world constraints.
    - Examples: “Must be completed within a $10,000 budget”, “Limited to open-source technologies”, “Should not exceed 500 words”.

## Examples

```md
Role: Act as a Project Manager of an Innovation Interdisciplinary Team.

Main Task: Develop a Project Plan for the upcoming product launch.

Steps to Complete Task:
1. Conduct a kickoff meeting with the project team to outline goals and expectations.
2. Break down the project into key phases and deliverables.
3. Define roles and responsibilities for each team member.
4. Estimate the duration and effort required for each task.
5. Identify dependencies between tasks and create a timeline.
6. Allocate resources and budget for the project.
7. Establish a risk management plan to mitigate potential issues.
8. Schedule regular progress meetings and checkpoints.
9. Develop a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed.
10. Finalize the project plan and obtain approval from key stakeholders.

Goal: Create a comprehensive Project Plan that ensures a successful and timely product launch, meeting quality standards and stakeholder expectations.

Constraints: Limited budget for unforeseen expenses, tight timeline due to market demands, and the need to coordinate with multiple departments within the organization.
