# Public Speaking

## Tips
Inspired by a post from Helene Guillaume.

### Own the Room Without Saying a Word
- Your presence talks before you do
- People size you up in the first 7 seconds

**Do This**

- Walk into your next meeting like the outcome is already yours
- Stand tall, move with purpose, own your space
- Watch the room shift in your favor

### Harness the Power of the Pause
- Silence creates gravity—your words *land*
- Rushed voices are forgettable; calm ones linger

**Do This**

- After your key point, silently count to 3
- It’ll feel weird—but your message will hit harder

### Speak in Bold Statements
- Short hits harder than long-winded
- Simplicity wins every time

**Do This**

- Boil down your big idea into 15 words or less
- Use that punchline to open strong

### Make Eye Contact a Weapon
- Lock in for 3–5 seconds with one person at a time
- Make people feel seen—not scanned

**Do This**

- Land each full thought on a single person before moving on
- Watch attention levels spike

### Let Your Hands Do the Talking
- Gestures turn ideas into visuals
- Hidden hands = hidden trust

**Do This**

- Show size with your hands when explaining numbers
- Use left/right gestures when comparing options

### Bring the Energy Everyone Feels
- People subconsciously sync with your vibe
- High energy creates connection without a word

**Do This**

- Before stepping up, move: arms up, jump, shake it out
- They'll catch your vibe before they even realize it

### Drop Fillers, Add Authority
- Replace “um” with pause
- Silence feels confident, not awkward

**Do This**

- Record a 2-minute talk
- Count the “ums,” then re-record with pauses instead
- You'll sound instantly sharper

### Smile With Intent
- Start and end warm—get serious in the middle
- Smiling with purpose shows strength, not softness

**Do This**

- Smile fully when you open and close
- During key messages, let your face show focus

### Leave Them With a Mental Spark
- Memorable closings beat forgettable Q&As
- A powerful question lingers far longer than a statement

**Do This**

- Instead of ending with “Any questions?”
- Say: “The real question isn’t *can* you do this—it’s *will* you let yourself?”
