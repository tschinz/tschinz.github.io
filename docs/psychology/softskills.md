## Treat **Your Career** Like a **Business**

- Write a "business statement" for yourself: "I provide X value to Y type of clients/companies."
  - Example: "I provide scalable web applications and mentoring to fast-growing startups."
- **Update your CV**, LinkedIn, and webpage to reflect your value.
- Evaluate yearly whether you need new “products” (skills).
- Keep a **list of clients** (employers/partners) and nurture those relationships.

## Set Clear, Long-Term Goals

- Define your **10-year target** (one sentence).
  - Format: "By [date], I will be [specific role] at [type of company] earning [amount] because I'm known for [expertise]."
- **Break it down**:
  - 3-year goal
  - 1-year goal
  - Quarterly goals
  - Weekly actions
- Review goals every Sunday for 10 minutes.
- Track progress in a simple tool (Notion, Obsidian, OneNote).

## Improve People Skills

- In every meeting:
  - Let the **other person speak first**.
  - Ask **clarifying questions**: "Can you help me understand..." "What would success look like for you..."
  - **Mirror their priorities** ("What matters most to them?").
- Practice **zero criticism**: when you want to correct, ask a question instead.
  - Instead of: "That won't work because..."
  - Try: "What challenges do you foresee with that approach?"
- Read (and apply) How to Win Friends and Influence People.
- Once per week, do one **positive interaction** email/message.

## Market Yourself

- Pick one channel:
  - Blog, LinkedIn, YouTube, conference talks.
- Produce **one piece of content per week** (short and simple).
  - Examples: 300-word blog post about a problem you solved, LinkedIn post sharing a lesson learned, 5-minute video explaining a concept.
- **Share your work publicly**: projects, insights, slides.
- Build an “expert sphere”: **choose your niche** and talk about it repeatedly.

## Learn How to Learn

Follow the 10-step learning loop:

- **Define** exactly what you want to learn
- Research and **gather materials**
- Create a **learning plan** (timeline: 2-4 weeks for most skills)
- **Learn basics** quickly (20% of time)
- Build a **small project** (practical application)
- **Deep dive** into missing topics
- Practice deliberately
- **Teach** what you learned (blog, a colleague)
- Repeat
- Measure progress

## Boost Productivity

- Use **Pomodoro** (25 min focus => 5 min break).
  - Tools: Forest app, Toggl, simple timer
  - Break activities: stretch, walk, hydrate (avoid social media)
- Create a **fixed daily routine**:
  - Morning = creative work
  - Afternoon = meetings
- **Avoid multitasking**: close all tabs except the project you’re doing.
- Start the day with a **top 3 list**:
  - “If I only finish these three tasks, today is a success.”
- Every Friday: weekly review.

## Prevent / Recover From Burnout

**Warning signs to watch for:**

- Dreading work, constant fatigue, irritability, decreased productivity

**Prevention & Recovery:**

- **Reduce cognitive load** - choose fewer goals.
- Introduce **minimal fitness** (walking, stretching).
- Create **hard barriers**:
  - No work after 19:00
  - No email on weekends
- **Find purpose**: reconnect your work to what matters to you.
- Take **one full day off per week with no obligations**.
- **Rate your energy levels 1-10 weekly** - track patterns
- If symptoms persist > 2 weeks, consider professional help

## Build Wealth Early

- **Negotiate salary** with each job change.
  - Research market rates on Glassdoor, Levels.fyi
  - Ask for 15-20% more than current salary when switching
- **Avoid all debt** except mortgage.
- **Pay yourself** first: automatic savings/investment (10–20%).
- **Invest long-term** (real estate or index funds).
- **Track your net worth** every month.
  - Tools: Mint, YNAB, or simple spreadsheet

## Build a Winning Mindset

- **Practice Stoicism**:
  - Control what you can
  - Accept what you cannot
  - Train discomfort
- Reprogram your **self-image**:
  - Daily affirmations
  - Act “as if” you already are the person you want to be
- Do **one uncomfortable thing per day**.
- Reflect daily (journaling).

## Strengthen Relationships

- Schedule weekly time for partner/family.
- Give **appreciation regularly** (verbal or written).
- Use the **assume positive intent** rule.
- When in conflict: listen => repeat back => respond calmly.
