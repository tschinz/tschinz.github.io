## Rules of Software Engineering

- You will **regret complexity** when on-call
- Everything is a trade-off. **There's no "best"**
- **Every line** of code you write **is a liability**
- **Document your decisions** and designs
- Don't use **unnecessary dependencies**
- **Coding standards** prevent arguments
- Write **meaningful commit messages**
- **Never stop learning**
- **Code reviews** spread knowledge
- Always **build for maintainability**
- **Ask for help** when you're stuck
- **Fix root causes**, not symptoms
- Software is **never completed**
- **Estimates are not promises**
- **Ship early**, iterate often
- **KISS** Keep It Simple
