# Cybersecurity Attacks

![](img/hacking.svg){.center width="20%"}

## Types of Cybersecurity Attacks

1. **Attacks without a Clear Goal**
   Often carried out by curious individuals or hobbyists, these attacks may lack a specific objective but can still cause significant harm or financial loss.

2. **Political Attacks**
   Motivated by ideology, these attacks aim to spread a message, commonly through website defacement or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

3. **Pentest (Penetration Testing)**
   Security audits designed to identify vulnerabilities. While valuable, some pentests are superficial, focusing on compliance rather than real security.

4. **Red Team**
   A more advanced form of security testing where testers simulate real attackers, often using social engineering, phishing, and even physical intrusion.

5. **Bug Bounty**
   Programs that incentivize external researchers to find and report vulnerabilities. While effective, they can sometimes be more about public image than genuine security.

6. **Cybercrime**
   The fastest-growing category, encompassing activities like data theft, ransomware, and credit card fraud, often driven by organized criminal networks.

7. **Industrial Spying**
   Espionage aimed at stealing trade secrets or intellectual property to gain a competitive edge, increasingly prevalent in the digital age.

8. **Cyberwar**
   State-sponsored or politically motivated attacks targeting critical infrastructure, often with far-reaching and dramatic consequences

## Phases of a Cyber Attack

1. **Reconnaissance**
   The attacker gathers information about the target, such as network structure, software versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Exploitation**
   The attacker uses the gathered information to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to systems.

3. **Lateral movememnt**
   Once inside, the attacker moves through the network to find valuable data or systems to compromise.

4. **Data exfiltration**
   The attacker extracts sensitive data from the target system, often using encryption or obfuscation to avoid detection.

5. **Clean up**
   The attacker removes traces of their presence to avoid detection and maintain access for future attacks.
