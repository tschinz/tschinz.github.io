### Server

For the server monitor you need to install the `tianji-reporter` onto your server. This can be done automatically for many distributions via the commandline:

```bash
curl -o- https://app-tianji.msgbyte.com/serverStatus/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/install.sh?url=https://app-tianji.msgbyte.com | sudo bash
```

If your server distribution is not supported (for example for Unraid Slackware) you can install and run it yourself. Download the `tianji-reporter` copy in onto your server and let is start once the server starts.

```bash
./tianji-reporter --url https://app-tianji.msgbyte.com --workspace xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
