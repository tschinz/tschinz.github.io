# Cloudflare

![](img/logo.svg){.center width="30.0%"}

## Introduction

Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and website security company that provides content delivery network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and distributed domain name server services.

I use it mainly to manage and buy custom domains, and to manage the DNS records of my domains as well as rules for that domains.
